We introduce two properties as desirable for a learning agent when in the presence of other learning agents, namely rationality and convergence. We examine existing reinforcement learning algorithms according to these two properties and notice that they fail to simultaneously meet both criteria. We then contribute a new learning algorithm, WoLF policy hillclimbing, that is based on a simple principle: “learn quickly while losing, slowly while winning.” The algorithm is proven to be rational and we present empirical results for a number of stochastic games showing the algorithm converges.  <br> - </details>

ICML 2000 <a href="https://www.Summary.so/instadeep/Multiagent-Learning-Basics-Challenges-and-Prospect-21cb7b4294b84a4188cafd184a3deed8">   </a> </summary> Stochastic games are a generalization of MDPs to multiple agents, and can be used as a framework for investigating multiagent learning. Hu and Wellman (1998) recently proposed a multiagent Q-learning method for general-sum stochastic games. In addition to describing the algorithm, they provide a proof that the method will converge to a Nash equilibrium for the game under specified conditions. The convergence depends on a lemma stating that the iteration used by this method is a contraction mapping. Unfortunately the proof is incomplete. In this paper we present a counterexample and flaw to the lemma’s proof. We also introduce strengthened assumptions under which the lemma holds, and examine how this affects the classes of games to which the theoretical result can be applied  <br> - </details>
