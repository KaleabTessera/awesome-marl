### Convergent Learning

<details> <summary> <a href="http://www.dklevine.com/archive/refs4415.pdf"> Learning Mixed Equilibria </a> by Drew Fundenberg, David M. Kreps. Journal of Games and Economic Behvaior, 1993.  </summary> We study learning processes for finite strategic-form games, in which players use the history of past play to forecast play in the current period. In a generalization of fictitious play, we assume only that players asymptotically choose best responses to the historical frequencies of opponents′ past play. This implies that if the stage-game strategies converge, the limit is a Nash equilibrium. In the basic model, plays seems unlikely to converge to a mixed-strategy equilibrium, but such convergence is natural when the stage game is perturbed in the manner of Harsanyi′s purification theorem.  <br> - </details>

AAAI, 1998.  </summary> Reinforcement learning can provide a robust and natural means for agents to learn how to coordinate their action choices in multiagent systems. We examine some of the factors that can influence the dynamics of the learning process in such a setting. We first distinguish reinforcement learners that are unaware of (or ignore) the presence of other agents from those that explicitly attempt to learn the value of joint actions and the strategies of their counterparts. We study (a simple form of) Q-learning in cooperative multiagent systems under these two perspectives, focusing on the influence of that game structure and exploration strategies on convergence to (optimal and suboptimal) Nash equilibria. We then propose alternative optimistic exploration strategies that increase the likelihood of convergence to an optimal equilibrium.  <br> - </details>

Roth. The American Economic Review, 1998. </summary> We examine learning in all experiments we could locate involving 100 periods or more of games with a unique equilibrium in mixed strategies, and in a new experiment. We study both the ex post ("best fit") descriptive power of learning models, and their ex ante predictive power, by simulating each experiment using parameters estimated from the other experiments. Even a one-parameter reinforcement learning model robustly outperforms the equilibrium predictions. Predictive power is improved by adding "forgetting" and "experimentation," or by allowing greater rationality as in probabilistic fictitious play. Implications for developing a low-rationality, cognitive game theory are discussed. <br> - </details>

Wellman. ICML, 1998. <a href="link">  </a> </summary> In this paper, we adopt general-sum stochastic games as a framework for multiagent reinforcement learning. Our work extends previous work by Littman on zero-sum stochastic games to a broader framework. We design a multiagent Q-learning method under this framework, and prove that it converges to a Nash equilibrium under specified conditions. This algorithm is useful for finding the optimal strategy when there exists a unique Nash equilibrium in the game. When there exist multiple Nash equilibria in the game, this algorithm should be combined with other learning techniques to find optimal strategies. <br> - </details>

<details> <summary> <a href="https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~bowling/papers/00icml.pdf"> Convergence Problems of General-Sum Multiagent Reinforcement Learning </a>by Michael Bowling. ICML, 2000. </summary> Stochastic games are a generalization of MDPs to multiple agents, and can be used as a framework for investigating multiagent learning. Hu and Wellman (1998) recently proposed a multiagent Q-learning method for general-sum stochastic games. In addition to describing the algorithm, they provide a proof that the method will converge to a Nash equilibrium for the game under specified conditions. The convergence depends on a lemma stating that the iteration used by this method is a contraction mapping. Unfortunately the proof is incomplete. In this paper we present a counterexample and flaw to the lemma’s proof. We also introduce strengthened assumptions under which the lemma holds, and examine how this affects the classes of games to which the theoretical result can be applied  <br> - </details>

<details> <summary> <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/papers/01ijcai-mike.pdf"> Rational and Convergent Learning in Stochastic Games </a>by Michael Bowling, Manuela Veloso. 2001. </summary> This paper investigates the problem of policy learning in multiagent environments using the stochastic game framework, which we briefly overview. We introduce two properties as desirable for a learning agent when in the presence of other learning agents, namely rationality and convergence. We examine existing reinforcement learning algorithms according to these two properties and notice that they fail to simultaneously meet both criteria. We then contribute a new learning algorithm, WoLF policy hillclimbing, that is based on a simple principle: “learn quickly while losing, slowly while winning.” The algorithm is proven to be rational and we present empirical results for a number of stochastic games showing the algorithm converges.  <br> - </details>

NeurIPS, 2001. </summary> We propose a new classification for multi-agent learning algorithms, with each league of players characterized by both their possible strategies and possible beliefs. Using this classification, we review the optimality of existing algorithms and discuss some insights that can be gained. We propose an incremental improvement to the existing algorithms that seems to achieve average payoffs that are at least the Nash equilibrium payoffs in the long-run against fair opponents. <br> - </details>

<details> <summary> <a href="https://www.aaai.org/Papers/Symposia/Spring/2002/SS-02-02/SS02-02-012.pdf"> Correlated-Q Learning </a>by Amy Greenwald, Keith Hall, Roberto Serrano. NeurIPS workshop on multi-agent learning, 2002. <a href="link">  </a> </summary> Bowling named two desiderata for multiagent learning algorithms: rationality and convergence. This paper introduces correlated-Q learning, a natural generalization of Nash-Q and FF-Q that satisfies these criteria. Nash-Q satisfies rationality, but in general it does not converge. FF-Q satisfies convergence, but in general it is not rational. Correlated-Q satisfies rationality by construction. This papers demonstrates the empirical convergence of correlated-Q on a standard testbed of general-sum Markov games. <br> - </details>

### Repeated games

<details> <summary> <a href="https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mmv/papers/01ijcai-mike.pdf"> Sophisticated EWA Learning and Strategic Teaching in Repeated Games </a>by Colin F. Camerer, Teck-Hua Ho, Juin-Kuan Chong. Journal of Economic Theory, 2002. <a href="https://www.Summary.so/instadeep/Multiagent-Learning-Basics-Challenges-and-Prospect-21cb7b4294b84a4188cafd184a3deed8">   </a> </summary> Most learning models assume players are adaptive (i.e., they respond only to their own previous experience and ignore others' payo® information) and behavior is not sensitive to the way in which players are matched. Empirical evidence suggests otherwise. In this paper, we extend our adaptive experienceweighted attraction (EWA) learning model to capture sophisticated learning and strategic teaching in repeated games. The generalized model assumes there is a mixture of adaptive learners and sophisticated players. An adaptive learner adjusts his behavior the EWA way. A sophisticated player rationally best-responds to her forecasts of all other behaviors. A sophisticated player can be either myopic or farsighted. A farsighted player develops multiple-period rather than single-period forecasts of others' behaviors and chooses to `teach' the other players by choosing a strategy scenario that gives her the highest discounted net present value. We estimate the model using data from p-beauty contests and repeated trust games with incomplete information. The generalized model is better than the adaptive EWA model in describing and predicting behavior. Including teaching also allows an empirical learning-based approach to reputation formation which predicts better than a quantal-response extension of the standard typebased approach. <br> - </details>

Contributions to the Theory of Games, 1959. <a href="link">  </a> </summary> This paper is concerned with the development of a dynamic theoryof decision under uncertainty. The results obtained are directly applicableto the development of a dynamic theory of games in which at least one play­er is, at each stage, fully informed on the joint empirical distribution ofthe past choices of strategies of the rest. Since the decision problem canbe Imbedded in a sufficiently unspecified game theoretic model, the paperis written in the language and notation of the general two person game, in which, however, player  I’s motivation is completely unspecified. <br> - </details>

### Decision theory

<details> <summary> <a href="https://www.ijcai.org/Proceedings/91-1/Papers/011.pdf"> A decision-theoretic approach to coordinating multiagent interactions </a>by Piotr J. Gmytrasiewicz, Edmund H. Durfee, David K. Weh. IJCAI, 1991. <a href="https://www.Summary.so/instadeep/Multiagent-Learning-Basics-Challenges-and-Prospect-21cb7b4294b84a4188cafd184a3deed8">  </a> </summary> We describe a decision-theoretic method that an autonomous agent can use to model multiagent situations and behave rationally based on its model. Our approach, which we call the Recursive Modeling Method, explicitly accounts for the recursive nature of multiagent reasoning. Our method lets an agent recursively model another agent's decisions based on probabilistic views of how that agent perceives the multiagent situation, which in turn are derived from hypothesizing how that other agent perceives the initial agent's possible decisions, and so on. Further, we show how the possibility of multiple interactions can affect the decisions of agents, allowing cooperative behavior to emerge as a rational choice of selfish agents that otherwise might behave uncooperatively <br> - </details>
