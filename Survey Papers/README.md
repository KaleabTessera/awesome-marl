# Deep vs Shallow learning

After 2014 and the success of DQN, there was a large shift towards Deep RL which made use of Neural Networks (NNs) for function approximation. This use of NNs brought about new challenges unique to the deep learning setting. As such there is a clear divide in the surveys of papers produced before and after this period.
